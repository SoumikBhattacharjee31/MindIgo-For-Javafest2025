Yes, I fully understand your idea — and it's **excellent**. You’re essentially turning the `content_service` into a **guided, expert-driven well-being journey system** that combines structured learning (courses), personal interaction (feedback), and monetization (subscription packages). Here's how I interpret and structure it:

---

## ✅ High-Level Idea: **Content as Guided Wellness Courses**

Under the `content_service`, you’re introducing a **course-based wellness module** where:

* **Experts** create and manage structured **courses** (e.g., "30 Days to Better Sleep").
* Each **course** has:

  * **Daily tasks**
  * **Exercises (mental, physical)**
  * **Meditation videos/audio**
  * **Reflections and feedback prompts**
* **Users** subscribe to **packages** to access courses (some free, some paid).
* Experts can **create custom-tailored courses** based on user feedback (e.g., sleep logs, mood trends).
* It includes a **feedback loop**, where user input dynamically influences content delivery.

## 🧩 Core Entities and Concepts

| Concept           | Description                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Course**        | A multi-day structured wellness program (like a curriculum) created by experts.     |
| **Day Task**      | Each day within a course includes specific activities (watch, reflect, do).         |
| **Exercise**      | Activities like journaling, breathing, yoga, mental games, or mindfulness.          |
| **Feedback**      | User input (e.g., sleep time, mood, energy levels) collected during or after tasks. |
| **Package**       | A subscription tier that grants access to a set of courses.                         |
| **Subscription**  | A user’s enrollment in a package (free or paid).                                    |
| **Custom Course** | Expert-generated course tailored to an individual user’s needs.                     |
